JSONToolView
============

Cross platform JSON viewer and editor.  It works okay.  Just a bit basic.  Only raw array editing is supported so far.

Don't use this with large files.

UI based off of Windows' Registry Editor.


Why?
----

Because I couldn't find a free, graphical JSON viewer and editor.
Well, there's [JSONEdit](http://tomeko.net/software/JSONedit/), but it has no UTF-8 support.


Compiling
---------

It's a simple NetBeans project, so just open it up and build.

A more recent copy of the `org.json` reference library is bundled under a different package name to avoid confusion with any existing copies you may have.
