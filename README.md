JSONToolView
============

Cross platform JSON viewer and editor.  
It works okay.

UI based off of Windows' Registry Editor.


Why?
----

Because I couldn't find a free, graphical JSON viewer and editor.
Well, there's [JSONEdit](http://tomeko.net/software/JSONedit/), but it has no UTF-8 support.


Compiling
---------

It's a simple NetBeans project, so just open it up and build.
